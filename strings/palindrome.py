# Find if a given string is a palindrome
# Palindrome strings read same from front and back 
# example 'aba' is a palindrome

# Algorithm 
    # Get the string_to_check from user
    # Reverse the string
    # Compare the original and reversed 
    # make decision based on palindrome string definition above


# TODO: implement the aboce algorithm here
