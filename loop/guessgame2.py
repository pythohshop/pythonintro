# Guess game 2
# Computer will guess a number 
# User will try to guess the computer_guess until 
# the uses_guess equals computer_guess

# Algorithm 
    # Computer guess a number
    # User guess
    # if user_guess equals computer_guess: congratulate and exit
    # if user_guess > computer_guess: inform user accordingly
    # if user_guess < computer_guess: inform accordingly


import random 

computer_guess = random.randint(0, 500)
print("Guess a number between 0-500\n")

# TODO: Implement the above algorithm here. Computer_guess is done for you
